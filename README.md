# MVC-Structure-Example
## Description

Using CodeIgniter v3 and as part of a university assignment, this project is to demonstrate the MVC (Model, View and Controller) architecture with a simple version of 'Twitter'. On this site, users can log into accounts (already created for testing purposes), view profiles, view user specific posts and search all posts.

The structure is as follows:

Controllers:
- Message
- Search
- User

Models:
- Messages_model
- Users_model

Views:
- error_page
- login_page
- messages_feed
- post_messages
- search_messages
- view_messages

Below is an image showing the searching functionality; displaying the post content, the date and time it was posted and by which user (whose profile you can navigate to my clicking their name in the post):
